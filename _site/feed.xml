    <content type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Never stop learning, try new things and build stuff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been my personal mantra most of my life.  Employing this in my design and development career has caused me to grow and advance in ways I could have never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Learn&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to learn is part of our human nature.  If we stop learning, we stop living.  This is ever so true in the world of design and development.  Never stop learning.  Never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Try&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered what my true passion was as I often have a exciting and new hobby.  Recently I realized my passion is trying new things, in life and in design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Build&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but most definitely the most important.  Just build.  By creating things you will be force you to learn and try new things that will advance you further than anything.  Just build stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Working Remote changed my life</title>
    <link href="http://callmeaaron.com/blog/2013/01/08/remote-working.html"/>
    <updated>2013-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://callmeaaron.com/blog/2013/01/08/remote-working</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A year and a half ago I left my corporate job and some how managed to get a solid raise and maintain amazing benefits.  After a year at that company it was time for me to leave and I managed to find another amazing job with amazing benefits.  This time it was with a high profile tech company working with some amazing people.  But probably the most amazing part of this time after leaving my corporate job was that I was able to stayed in my home town that I love so dearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;This is why I think remote working is the bomb.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searching Authentic jobs, dribble and others I&amp;rsquo;m consistently amazed at the remote oportunites that are available.  I feel so lucky to be living in this time where I can do what I love and work for conceivably any company.  This type of oportunity has only been possible in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;What makes this possible?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google.  In one word Google has made much of this possible.  Between google docs, hangouts, chat, gmail and everything else they&amp;rsquo;ve created the perfect suite for remote teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of other players in the game too that only make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skype is an amazing tool that has a great breath of features for free.  They also have the most tallented animated gif team on the internet.  Hands down.  No question about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireframing tools are in no short supply.  Balsamiq lead the charge in this field but there are many others now.  Not sure any have nailed it home but there are plenty of options here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basecamp is one of my all in one favorites.  There are a lot of haters here and in my experience if someone has had one bad experience with basecamp they hate it.  But when it&amp;rsquo;s used to it&amp;rsquo;s fullest it is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many tools for remote workers it&amp;rsquo;s really not much different than being in the office with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that I want to change about my remote working experience is my working situation.  Curently I work alone.  By myself.  Solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve known the solution for this for a long time but until recently it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t a possibility.  But in the past couple months things have been coming together and a buddy and I are heading up a coworking space.  It&amp;rsquo;s not even open yet and it&amp;rsquo;s already been one of the most fullfilling things I&amp;rsquo;ve done since I started working remote.  I look forward to sharing how this goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote working has allowed me to grow in ways that I never thought possible while staying in a place I love and remaining close to family and friends.  Sure, I could move to California, New York or any of the hot spots and get a job pretty quickly.  But I love Bloomington, Indiana and I&amp;rsquo;ll stay here as long as I can.  Hopefully until the day I die.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Site</title>
    <link href="http://callmeaaron.com/blog/2012/11/08/new-site.html"/>
    <updated>2012-11-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://callmeaaron.com/blog/2012/11/08/new-site</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seems like about every few months I want to redesign my website.  And about once a year I actually make time to do so.  Well that time has come and below I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined a few of the big changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;From WordPress to Jekyll&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my last several sites I&amp;rsquo;ve used Wordpress.  It has been great to use over the years but I&amp;rsquo;m getting to the point where it&amp;rsquo;s just more than I really need.  I&amp;rsquo;m also getting tired of managing updates and all the plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; After some inspiration from the guys from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoptalkshow.com/&quot;&gt;Shop Talk Show&lt;/a&gt; as well as me being much more comfortable using Terminal I decided to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What I like about this change&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure and fast&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; With WordPress there are so many security risks.  It seems like I get spam comments on my WordPress site on a daily basis.  If you&amp;rsquo;re WP instance isn&amp;rsquo;t upgraded to the most recent version it&amp;rsquo;s susceptible to getting hacked.  There are also plugin dependencies based on what version you are on. So some plugins might not work on the most recent version.  It goes on and on.  And let&amp;rsquo;s be real here, this is my personal site so it falls about last in the priority of work so it&amp;rsquo;s tough to keep track of all that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Jekyll all of these issues are gone.  Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby.  So basically it compiles the whole site locally with Ruby magic and serves your static HTML site.  So the only thing you ever push to your server is the static site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version Control and Deploying&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Jekyll integrates with Github Pages.  This not only makes deploying as easy as a git commit, but it automatically integrates version control into your deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping in simple&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; When I say simple, I mean what I like best.  In the end Jekyll sites are HTML/CSS/JS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt;.  Liquid is well documented and easy to understand template syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last note is that as easy as Jekyll was for me, some designers might not love it as it does require you to use Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning! Warning! I&amp;rsquo;m about to have a soapbox moment&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash;
Most &amp;ldquo;designers&amp;rdquo; will probably immediately run from Jekyll because the first thing you have to do is open Terminal.  I used to be just like that.  I thought if there wasn&amp;rsquo;t an app with a beautiful UI for something, a designer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t touch it.  But using Terminal opens so many doors. Knowing the simplest commands allows you to do so many awesome things.  I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to give it a go.  It will allow you to create and contribute to things that you simple can&amp;rsquo;t without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember to learn, try and build.  &lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;trying&lt;/strong&gt; Terminal will allow you to &lt;strong&gt;build&lt;/strong&gt; things you couldn&amp;rsquo;t before.  And that&amp;rsquo;s what it&amp;rsquo;s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Early Stage Styling Done Just Right</title>
    <link href="http://callmeaaron.com/blog/2012/05/12/style-tiles.html"/>
    <updated>2012-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://callmeaaron.com/blog/2012/05/12/style-tiles</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt; Many times stakeholders or clients are more concerned with logos, colors and fonts.  When the main focus of the design process should be on workflows, content and wireframes they are more concerned with the look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most often you’ll go ahead and open photoshop and style the crap out of your wireframes.  This is fine, because sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t have any other options, but most likely this will slow down your wire framing.  When wire framing all focus should be put on layout, content, workflows and UX.  If you’re in photoshop worrying about what color that button should be or how much shadow to put on that container the thought being put into workflows, content and UX will most definitely suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://f.cl.ly/items/400t3n1Q0q0A2t2a3V1m/Style%20Tiles%20Just%20right.png&quot; alt=&quot;Just Right&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I wasn’t able to go to ConvergeSE this year, I did keep a close eye on my Twitter stream during the conference.  There were several gems that came through the stream and one of those was Style Tiles.  Style Tiles allows you to present interface choices without making the investment in multiple photoshop mockups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the put in on their site.  “Style tiles are for when a moodboard is too vague and a comp is too literal.”  To me, this is the best of both worlds.  Appropriate focus can be put on layout, content, workflows and UX when working on the wireframes because you can put all visual elements in the Style Tile.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://f.cl.ly/items/3R2k1v1H1n0V062x3V3l/Image%202012.11.06%2010:46:57%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example Style Tile&quot;&gt;
What could be included in a style tile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image treatment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Clients and stakeholders will always be excited about the visual style of the site you’ll be building for them.  They should be.  That’s why they are having you design their product, because your a kick ass designer.  So make sure neither deliverable is neglected.  Give them a well thought out wireframes and the beautiful style tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
